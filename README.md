# Credit-Card-Fraud-Classification

This project aims to classify our credit card holders as either a defaulter or a non-defaulter so that the bank can make appropriate decisions to approve the loan depending on the resulting classification.

We used techniques such as exploratory data analysis, visualisation, data pre-processing, feature selection and explored different machine learning (ML) models before evaluating the most appropriate model for our classification based on our results.
